I have worked on the UI part, allowing users to input space dimensions, select insulation quality, and choose daily run times. The UI dynamically calculates and displays the total volume and recommended BTUs based on user inputs.

Could you please clarify which collection will be shown based on the BTU value? This is important because there are multiple collections available.

Today, I worked on the following points:

Calculated the watts of solar panels and displayed the products of the collection according to their harvest value.
Worked on displaying suitable charge controllers.
Worked on offering battery options.
Implemented the "Add to Cart" functionality; when a customer selects products and clicks the "Add to Cart" button, the product will be added to the cart.
Currently, I am working on displaying the total values of the selected products.

Today, I worked on the following tasks:

Improved the UI for the custom page.
Implemented functionality to display the total price of selected products before adding them to the cart.
Worked on creating custom products based on the values for the distance from panels to the battery and from the battery to HVAC. These products are only for adding to the cart and won't be visible in the store.

If you want any changes in UI, please let me know.
