I have worked on the UI part, allowing users to input space dimensions, select insulation quality, and choose daily run times. The UI dynamically calculates and displays the total volume and recommended BTUs based on user inputs.

Could you please clarify which collection will be shown based on the BTU value? This is important because there are multiple collections available.

Today, I worked on the following points:

Calculated the watts of solar panels and displayed the products of the collection according to their harvest value.
Worked on displaying suitable charge controllers.
Worked on offering battery options.
Implemented the "Add to Cart" functionality; when a customer selects products and clicks the "Add to Cart" button, the product will be added to the cart.
Currently, I am working on displaying the total values of the selected products.

Today, I worked on the following tasks:

Improved the UI for the custom page.
Implemented functionality to display the total price of selected products before adding them to the cart.
Worked on creating custom products based on the values for the distance from panels to the battery and from the battery to HVAC. These products are only for adding to the cart and won't be visible in the store.

If you want any changes in UI, please let me know.

I have worked on creating a custom product based on the distance from the panels to the battery and the distance from the battery to the HVAC. I have also created a variant for this product and ensured it does not appear in the storefront. Currently, I am working on enabling customers to add this product to the cart.

I have updated the formula to calculate total harvest value using this formula: 
    harvest = BTU/16 *{value from 4} * {value from 2}
I have update the UI and dispaly the image and description in step 2 and step 4 points.
I am working on resolving an issue while i create a varient for custome product.
I am adding an screenshots of step 2 and step 4, if you want any changes, please let me know.

Today, I worked on the following tasks:

Updated the formula to calculate the "recommended BTU" and removed the "Calculate BTU" button. Now, the Total BTU is displayed automatically when all values (length, width, and height) are provided.
Displayed the recommended BTU value based on the insulation value change.
Updated step 2 and step 4 by making the entire box clickable.
Worked on updating the available quantities of the custom-created product and enabling it to be added to the cart.
